the
sun
was
shining
brightly
in
the
sky
as
I
walked
down
the
street
I
could
feel
the
warmth
on
my
skin
and
the
gentle
breeze
blowing
through
my
hair
it
was
a
beautiful
day
the
kind
of
day
that
made
me
happy
to
be
alive
as
I
walked
I
thought
about
all
the
things
I
wanted
to
accomplish
that
day
I
had
a
long
list
of
errands
to
run
and
tasks
to
complete
but
I
was
determined
to
get
everything
done
I
was
determined
to
make
the
most
of
this
beautiful
day
I
stopped
at
the
corner
to
wait
for
the
traffic
light
to
change
as
I
stood
there
I
noticed
a
little
girl
playing
with
a
ball
on
the
sidewalk
she
was
laughing
and
smiling
completely
lost
in
the
joy
of
the
moment
I
could
help
but
smile
too
when
the
light
changed
I
crossed
the
street
and
continued
on
my
way
I
stopped
at
the
grocery
store
to
pick
up
a
few
items
for
dinner
and
then
headed
to
the
post
office
to
mail
a
letter
I
was
making
good
progress
but
I
still
had
a
lot
to
do
as
the
day
went
on
I
completed
one
task
after
another
I
went
to
the
bank
the
library
and
the
dry
cleaners
I
ran
all
my
errands
and
checked
everything
off
my
list
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
I
was
proud
of
myself
for
getting
everything
done
but
even
though
I
was
tired
from
a
long
day
of
running
around
I
was
still
filled
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
and
accomplishment
I
had
made
the
most
of
this
beautiful
day
and
I
was
ready
to
do
it
all
again
tomorrow
the
sun
was
setting
now
casting
a
warm
golden
glow
over
the
city
I
took
a
deep
breath
and
smiled
it
had
been
a
good
day
a
productive
day
and
I
was
grateful
for
every
moment
of
it
I
sat
at
my
desk
staring
at
the
blank
screen
in
front
of
me
I
knew
I
had
a
lot
of
work
to
do
but
for
some
reason
I
just
could
seem
to
get
started
I
felt
overwhelmed
and
unsure
of
where
to
begin
I
took
a
deep
breath
and
tried
to
focus
I
reminded
myself
that
I
was
a
capable
and
competent
person
and
that
I
could
handle
whatever
came
my
way
I
thought
about
all
the
things
I
had
accomplished
in
the
past
and
how
I
had
always
managed
to
find
a
way
to
get
things
done
slowly
I
began
to
type
the
words
started
to
flow
and
before
I
knew
it
I
was
deep
in
the
work
I
was
focused
and
determined
and
I
was
making
progress
as
the
hours
passed
I
continued
to
work
tirelessly
I
tackled
one
project
after
another
always
moving
forward
I
did
let
anything
distract
me
and
I
did
allow
myself
to
get
bogged
down
by
any
setbacks
I
was
determined
to
get
everything
done
eventually
I
reached
a
point
where
I
had
completed
all
of
my
tasks
I
sat
back
in
my
chair
and
let
out
a
sigh
of
relief
I
was
exhausted
but
I
was
also
proud
of
myself
I
had
worked
hard
and
I
had
achieved
a
lot
I
got
up
from
my
desk
and
stretched
my
tired
muscles
I
looked
out
the
window
and
saw
that
the
sun
was
starting
to
set
it
had
been
a
long
and
productive
day
and
I
was
ready
to
relax
and
unwind
I
went
downstairs
and
made
myself
a
cup
of
tea
I
sat
in
my
favorite
chair
and
let
the
warm
liquid
soothe
my
tired
body
as
I
sipped
my
tea
I
thought
about
all
the
things
I
had
accomplished
that
day
I
felt
a
sense
of
satisfaction
and
accomplishment
and
I
was
grateful
for
the
opportunity
to
do
the
work
that
I
loved
it
had
been
a
good
day
a
productive
day
and
I
was
ready
to
do
it
all
again
tomorrow
