# Text Input Prediction and Completion
The program inserts words and grams read from text files that are generated by a python script sample_processing.py which is also included in the repository. 

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a text input prediction tool much like that used in smartphone keyboards. It uses a combination of a hash map and a trie data structure to store words, word sequences (called "grams"), and both their respective frequencies of occurance.  When a user inputs a word prefix the program suggests five potential comlpetions of the prefix by finding the words that have the input string as a prefix in the trie.  When a user inputs a gram of 2 or 3 words, the program suggests five potential words that could follow the gram.  Any suggested words are sorted in descending order of their frequency of usage so that the most frequently used words are suggested first.

The classes are as follows:

## SugResult:
This class contains a suggested word and its frequency of usage.

## GramNode:
This class contains an n-gram and its frequency of usage.

## GramsFrequencyMap:
This class is a hashmap that stores n-grams and their frequencies of usage. It has four members: capacity, which stores the capacity of the hashmap, size, which stores the current size of the hashmap, gram_map, which is a vector that stores the n-grams and their frequencies, and keys, a vector that contains any used hashcodes.

## CharacterMap:
This class contains the root node of the trie that stores words and their frequencies of usage. It has five members: capacity, which stores the capacity of the hashmap, size, which stores the current size of the hashmap, map, which is the array that stores the pointers to the nodes, grams, which is an instance of the GramsFrequencyMap class that stores the n-grams for the words stored in the trie, and keys, a vector that contains any used hashcodes.

## InputPrediction:
This class is the main class that implements the word suggestion functionality.

The quickSort function at the end of the program is a quicksort implementation that can be used to sort the words retreived in ascending order of frequency. This allows the program to present the most frequently used words that could follow a given 2 or 3 word gram or complete a given prefix.
